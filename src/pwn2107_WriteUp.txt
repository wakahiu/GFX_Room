THE MODEL
This project models a furnitureless room with animated objects in it. There is a planar serial chain manipulator and a humanoid with end effectors at the hands, feet and head.

ANIMATIONS
Solutions to the animation problem are found by the least squares problem. I used the Dampled leasts squares with a static lambda parameter.


USER INTERACTION
Animations, motion and screen capture are enabled by pressing/toggling the folllowing keys.

	1,2,3 Selects the models
	drag mouse - in inverse kinematics mode to move effectors (light green)
	right click - When in inverse Kinematics selects the end effector
	left click - when in Forward Kinematics mode selects the joint to rotate about
	space = toggle Inverse an Forward kinematics.
	+/-	= Rotate selected object in Forward Kinmatics mode.
   	r	= (toggle) Screen capture.
   	w	= Move Forward
	s	= Move Backward
	d	= Move right
	a	= Move left
